# hello-world
This is my first repository. It is being used to learn how to use GitHub effectively.
ABOUT ME:
I am really new to Programming. I am on my 12th week of a twice-a-week Python class, hosted by LaunchCode. While many people in the class seem to have some prior knowledge of programming practices of some kind whether it was proprietary or other languages, some of us had none. I am one of those people. I am really enjoying it though!!!
